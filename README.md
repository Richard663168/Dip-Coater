**Other Materials**
* 4 6mm 12" x 24" black acrylic sheets
* Wires
* Super glue
* 1 USB cable
* 1 2.1 x 5.5 12V power cable
  
Black acrylic sheets could be replaced by other 6mm-thick laser cuttable materials.
## 3D Printing Instructions
3D printing files: Complete files are included in this current repository including .stl file format to be directly printable after slicing and .step file format to allow easy import and manipulation in most CAD software. All models were designed using Autodesk Fusion 360.

Designs are printed out using the Stratasys Elite and Stratasys Mojo with a layer height of 0.178mm (0.007in) and ABS plus P430 as the printing material.

## Laser Cutting Instructions
Laser Cutting files: Complete files are included in this current repository including .ai file format and .svg file format. All models were designed using Adobe Illustrator. Designs are laser cut using Epilog mini and Epilog Fusion with 6mm 12"x24" black acrylic sheets.  

The labels on the designs are for illustration only. It is recommanded to delete those labels before laser cutting or the labels might be engraved onto the final product. For Epilog laser cutters, the widths of the lines for laser cutting need to be set to 0.001pt.  

## Circuit Design

Breadboards shown in the circuit diagram are not required. It is recommanded to use solder or heat shrinking tubes to connect wires to electronic compoenents and other wires in order to secure the connections.
